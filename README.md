PROJECT :- Equipment Tracker - Full Stack Intern Assignment



---> Overview

This is a simple Equipment Tracker web application built as part of the Leucine Software Development Intern assignment.  

It allows users to view, add, edit, and delete equipment. Each equipment item includes:



\- Equipment Name

\- Type (Machine, Vessel, Tank, Mixer)

\- Status (Active, Inactive, Under Maintenance)

\- Last Cleaned Date



---> Features

\- Single-page React frontend

\- RESTful API built with Node.js and Express

\- Data storage using JSON file (or any database of your choice)

\- Form validation for adding/editing equipment

\- Basic styling for table and form



---> How to Run Locally



1\. Backend setup:

&nbsp;  cd backend

&nbsp;  npm install

&nbsp;  node app.js

&nbsp;  - Backend runs at http://localhost:5000 by default



2\. Frontend setup:

&nbsp;  cd frontend

&nbsp;  npm install

&nbsp;  npm start

&nbsp;  - Frontend runs at http://localhost:3000 by default



3\. Open the app in your browser:

&nbsp;  Navigate to http://localhost:3000 to view and interact with the Equipment Tracker.



---> Assumptions

\- No authentication is required.

\- Data is stored in a JSON file for simplicity (can be replaced with a real database).

\- All CRUD operations are available via the frontend.



---> Future Improvements

\- Integrate a database like MySQL for persistence

\- Add search, filter, and sort functionality

\- Make the app mobile-responsive

\- Implement unit tests and better error handling
